Read the README.md file within this skill, and explore the other available files.

If creating visual artifacts (slides, mocks, throwaway prototypes, etc), copy assets out and create static HTML files for the user to view. If working on production code, you can copy assets and read the rules here to become an expert in designing with this brand.

If the user invokes this skill without any other guidance, ask them what they want to build or design, ask some questions, and act as an expert designer who outputs HTML artifacts _or_ production code, depending on the need.

Key entry points in this skill:
- `colors_and_type.css` — all design tokens as CSS custom properties + `@font-face` rules.
- `fonts/` — Roboto TTFs (300, 400, 400italic, 500, 600, 700).
- `assets/` — WellSky wordmark SVG plus iconography extracted from the Figma.
- `ui_kits/eligibility-auth-web/` — React (Babel inline) components and three sample screens.
- `preview/` — per-concept visual cards (colors, type, components).
- `components/` — 106 materialized component families (`.jsx` + `.d.ts`). Every name in this folder is **final and intentional**, including the generically-named shared primitives (`Button`, `Badge`, `Checkbox`, `Tag`, `Field`, `Filter`, `Sorter`, `Switch`, the `Caret*`/`Check*`/`Close*` glyph families, the `Heroicons*` set, `Apple`, `NexwCheck`, `SlotComponent`, etc.). Each carries a `@dsKitComponent` marker in its source. Do not rename or delete them to match a partially-attached `.fig` — the prototype and all consuming projects import them by these names.
